Add new `CardLoading` skeleton component for card placeholders

### What Changed

- Introduced the `CardLoading` skeleton component to indicate content is being loaded inside a card
- Displays placeholder elements for avatar, text bar, link, and icon to simulate the final layout
- Ensures consistent loading experience across different parts of the application

### Example Usage

```tsx
<CardLoading />
```

This component provides a consistent visual skeleton for cards during data loading, helping improve perceived performance and maintain layout stability while content is fetched.
